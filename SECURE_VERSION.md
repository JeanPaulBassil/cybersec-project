# Secure Version of SQL Injection Demo

This is the secure version of the SQL Injection Demo, which implements proper security practices to prevent SQL injection attacks.

## Running the Secure Version

```bash
# Run the secure version on port 8081
docker-compose -f docker-compose.secure.yml up --build
```

Access the secure application at <http://localhost:8081>

## Security Improvements

The following security measures have been implemented:

1. **Parameterized Queries**: Instead of concatenating user input directly into SQL queries, we use parameterized queries with placeholders. This ensures that user input is properly escaped and treated as data, not executable code.

   ```python
   # VULNERABLE (original version):
   query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '{username}' AND password = '{password}'"
   
   # SECURE (new version):
   query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = %s AND password = %s"
   cursor.execute(query, (username, password))
   ```

2. **Input Validation**: Basic validation is performed on user inputs before processing them.

3. **Error Handling**: Error messages are sanitized to prevent information leakage about the database structure.

## Testing Both Versions

We've included a test script that demonstrates how SQL injection attacks work on the vulnerable version but fail on the secure version:

```bash
# First, make sure both versions are running:
# Original vulnerable version on port 8080
docker-compose up -d
# Secure version on port 8081
docker-compose -f docker-compose.secure.yml up -d

# Run the test script
pip install requests
python test_sql_injection.py
```

## Additional Security Recommendations

For a production environment, consider these additional security measures:

1. Use prepared statements consistently throughout the application
2. Implement proper authentication with secure password hashing (e.g., bcrypt)
3. Apply the principle of least privilege to database users
4. Use HTTPS for all communications
5. Implement Web Application Firewall (WAF) protection
6. Regularly update dependencies and apply security patches
